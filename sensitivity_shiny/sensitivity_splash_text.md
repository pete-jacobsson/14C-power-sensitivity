This app is intended to visualize and explore the results of the work carried out as a part of project exploring the use of interlinking R and OxCal in radiocarbon power and sensitvity analyses. 

The project was based on autmated generation of simulated OxCal models subject to systematic offset and error underreporting in R, passing these models to OxCal for evaluation and parsing the data using R.

Altogether this app is based on the results of almost half a million simulations covering single calibrations, wiggle-match dates and uniform bound sequence models. 

The topics covered are:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Maximum Permissable Offset estimations from the raw simulated results
- Modelling of the results, both to explore the itneractions of differant variables and systematic offsets and also for prediction of offset sensitvity under different model structures.
