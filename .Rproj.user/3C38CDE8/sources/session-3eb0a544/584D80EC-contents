This document contains the research notes from the analysis of the simulations conducted using R and OxCal. This is a rough notebook that begins at the point when the project was re-initiated in June 2023 until completion

##Part 1: make sense of what is here and order things up
The first thing that I spotted was that much of the data files were sitting right in the main folder. So this will get ordered up - but I'll leave the Markdown files describing everything on top (I might need them lets see if past me had any brains worth of brain :P).

Next will be working out what the individual simulations are and what they cover - as well as taking some time to play with the Shiny App that I built to support the EDA. 
The thing looks much better now.
